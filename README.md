# Web Scraping Airbnb Page with BeautifulSoup - Python Project

My first web scraping application 

## 🚀 To understand this project

The application has one class called `WebScraping` wich contain two attributes, six private methods and one public method. Inside of the main file, we defined the target url, created an instance of the class passing the url as a parameter, and called the method to print informations like Title, Subtitle, Price, Number of beds, bedrooms, bathrooms and Guests.   

## 🛠️ Built with
